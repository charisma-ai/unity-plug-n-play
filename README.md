If you have any questions or need a hand, please reach out to us at [hello@charisma.ai](mailto:hello@charisma.ai)!

## Getting started

**Important:** Before setting up the Charisma SDK for Unity, you’ll need to have created a web or game story (not an app story!), which requires a Charisma licence. Please visit the [licencing docs on our website](https://charisma.ai/docs/licencing) for more info!

If you haven’t already, go ahead and create an Unity project. Make sure you are using a version of the engine that is supported by this plugin.

## Importing / Installing

**Important:** Make sure to install the [Charisma Unity SDK] (https://github.com/charisma-ai/charisma-sdk-unity) in order to enable the Plug-N-Play plugin to work.

Open Unity's Package Manager by heading to `Window -> Package Manager`. Click the plus icon, and select "Add package from Git URL". Enter https://github.com/charisma-ai/unity-plug-n-play.git and press Add.

Unity will download the Charisma package into your project as a package. This includes an example scene and script which can be found by expanding the "Samples" drop-down when the package is highlighted in the Package Manager, and importing the "Example".

## Using the Plug-N-Play

Please refer to our [SDK Documentation page] (https://charisma.ai/docs/sdks) and [Unity Tutorial series] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJL7mxAoErKzABDahUXzjNBNM7GUjUF45) for more information on how to setup and use the Plug-N-Play for your stories!
