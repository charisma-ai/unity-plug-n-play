## Getting started

**Important:** Before setting up the Charisma SDK for Unity, youâ€™ll need to have created a Pro story (not a Starter story!), which requires a Charisma licence. Please visit the [licencing docs on our website](https://charisma.ai/docs/licencing) for more info!

## Importing / Installing

**Important:** Make sure to install the [Charisma Unity SDK](https://github.com/charisma-ai/charisma-sdk-unity) in order to enable the Plug-N-Play plugin to work.

Open Unity's Package Manager by heading to `Window -> Package Manager`. Click the plus icon, and select "Add package from Git URL". Enter https://github.com/charisma-ai/unity-plug-n-play.git and press Add.

Unity will download the Charisma package into your project as a package. This includes an example scene and script which can be found by expanding the "Samples" drop-down when the package is highlighted in the Package Manager, and importing the "Example".

## Using the Plug-N-Play

Please refer to the [Charisma Unity SDK](https://github.com/charisma-ai/charisma-sdk-unity#plug-n-play) guide to find out how to connect the example scene to your Charisma story.

Also, check out our [SDK Documentation page](https://charisma.ai/docs/sdks) and [Unity Tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJL7mxAoErKzABDahUXzjNBNM7GUjUF45) for more information on how to use the Plug-N-Play for your stories!
